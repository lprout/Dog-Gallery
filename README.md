```
AS AN Administator I WANT TO monitor submissions and contact forms SO THAT I can continually update the website with new photos and make stylistic and functional changes based on user feedback. 

AS A dog lover I WANT TO view pictures of dogs and submit photos of my dogs SO THAT I can learn how to photograph my pets better. 

AS A photographer I WANT TO view average/amateur photos of dogs SO THAT I can see how average pet owners photograph their dogs and give suggestions for improving pet photography skills.
